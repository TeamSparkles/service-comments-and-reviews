## Usage

Run `npm run start` to start this service on 'localhost:3000' and `npm run build` to start webpack. The server will return all the comments and replies associated with the MeetUp event with the id of '241049102'. This event contains two top-level comments and six replies, which is the largest data set in our 107 sample event data. To reference the original webpage of this event on MeetUp, visit https://www.meetup.com/EastBayBookClub/events/241049102/.

Data is stored in MongoDB and follows the exact same schema that MeetUp uses on their website. To request the comments and replies data in JSON for a specific event, run `mongo` and `use meetup` to get the id of each event, then navigate to 'http://localhost:3000/events/event_id/comments'. Data shape can be referenced in `schema.js`. For more information on MeetUp's RESTful HTTP interfaces, visit https://www.meetup.com/meetup_api/docs/:urlname/events/:event_id/comments/#list.
